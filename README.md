The rise of social media, like Twitter and Facebook, has generated a lot of online data. 
This data can reveal student’s feelings and thoughts about their education, but it's hard to analyze 
due to its complexity and volume. To address this, a hybrid method is used to study 25,000 tweets 
from engineering students. They find that students commonly face issues like heavy workloads, 
diversity challenges, and negative emotions. They then create a hybrid model by combining Naïve 
Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms, which greatly improves the accuracy and reduces 
training time for classifying these tweets about student problems
Nowadays, social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and You-Tube has become popular as 
many people share their views, opinions or thoughts on these sites. Also, college students shows a 
deep interest in sharing their views on these sites and thereby seeking social support. They have 
group conversations, discussions, vent their emotions, etc. on these sites and usually, not in formal 
or machine readable form. 
Understanding of such huge data helps to obtain learning experiences of students but also raises 
the problem of extracting sensible data out of unstructured social media data for the benefits of 
educational institutions. The difficulties in understanding this data are large data sets, Internet slang 
words, the time and the locations when student posts on the web and the complex nature of 
student’s experiences. The pure manual analysis can’t handle this large scale data and on the other 
hand, pure automatic algorithms can’t take in-depth meaning in this large scale data.
